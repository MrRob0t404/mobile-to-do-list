# Mobile todo app

Wanted to play around with react native so I made this simple todo app
You can see the design below as well as the color pallet I decided to go with.

## How to run locally

Please follow the official Expo documentation to setup your local enviornment
https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/

Then cd into the repo and run the following commands:

```
cd mobile-to-do-list
npm ci
npm start
```

There you go! If you have any issues using this app, please open up an issue and I will take a look at it as soon as possible.
